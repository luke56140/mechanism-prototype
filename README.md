<h1>Prototyping of a Mechanism</h1>

**Course:** MECHENG 334 – Design and Manufacture 3 <br> 
**Institution:** University of Auckland <br> 
**Date:** March–April 2025

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
With a partner, the objective was to design, simulate, and prototype a compact mechanical system that could transfer a 9.5 mm steel ball from an input to an output point within a constrained 100 × 100 × 100 mm acrylic cube. The design was to be powered by a single-direction 60 RPM rotating shaft and reset automatically. The prototype had to be manufacturable using additive methods (3D printing) and laser cutting.
<br />


<h2>Key contributions:</h2>

- **CAD Modelling:** Created complete 3D part and assembly models in Autodesk Inventor, conforming to spatial and functional constraints.  
- **Dynamic Simulation:** Conducted motion simulations in Inventor to verify kinematic feasibility and compliance with the 5-second transit and reset requirements.  
- **Prototyping:** Prepared STL files, arranged build plates, and carried out 3D printing of components using PLA. Participated in laser cutting of acrylic elements.
- **Assembly Documentation:** Authored detailed step-by-step instructions for mechanism assembly using labelled diagrams and user-focused explanations.
- **Physical Assembly:** Assembled the mechanism and iterated minor design modifications to improve robustness and ease of reset.  


<h2> Skills and Tools Used </h2>

- <b>Mechanical Design & Kinematics</b> 
- <b>CAD: Auto Desk Inventor</b> 
- <b>Dynamic Simulation: Auto Desk Inventor</b> 
- <b>3D Printing using PLA</b> 
- <b>Technical Documentation & Team Collaboration</b> 

<h2>Outcomes</h2>

- <b>The mechanism successfully moved the steel ball from input to output in the objective 5 seconds and reliably reset within the 20-second constraint.</b>
- <b>The prototype operated consistently during demonstration and testing, validating both the virtual and physical models.</b>
- <b>Scored 100% for the physical demonstration.</b>
